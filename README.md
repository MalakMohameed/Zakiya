# Zakiya

**Zakiya** is an AI-driven text detection system designed to automate actions for specific accounts within a banking system. It leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze textual information and trigger predefined actions based on detected patterns and keywords.

This project is designed for internal use within secure banking environments.

## Overview

Zakiya monitors and analyzes text fields within banking systems, detecting specific patterns or keywords that represent potential issues or required actions.
Upon detection, the system automatically triggers the appropriate action without manual intervention, streamlining operations and reducing human error.

---

## Features

* **🔍 Text Analysis:** Uses NLP to process and analyze free-form text fields.
* **⚙️ Automated Actions:** Triggers actions such as flagging accounts, sending alerts, or logging incidents.
* **🛡️ Secure by Design:** Developed for secure environments with access control and encryption.
* **🔧 Customizable Rules:** Easily update detection rules to adapt to changing operational needs.
* **🔌 Integration Ready:** Designed to integrate with internal systems via secure APIs or internal service calls.
* **📊 Real-Time Processing:** Detects and responds to events in real-time.

+-------------------------+      +--------------------+      +--------------------------+
|  Internal Text Streams  | ---> |   Zakiya Engine    | ---> |   Internal Action System |
|  (Transaction Notes)    |      | (NLP & ML Engine)  |      | (Flags, Alerts, Reports) |

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/zakiya.git
   cd zakiya
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. *(Optional)* **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

---

## Usage

* Run the main detection script inside your environment:

  ```bash
  python zakiya_main.py
  ```
* The system will analyze text passed to it and trigger actions based on your configured rules.

---

## Configuration

Detection rules and actions are defined in a configuration file (e.g., `rules_config.json`).

Example rules file:

```json
{
    "flag_patterns": ["suspicious activity", "unauthorized login", "high risk transfer"],
    "notify_patterns": ["account locked", "urgent action required", "limit exceeded"]
}
```

You can add, remove, or update patterns as your operational needs evolve.

---

## Example Workflow

| Example Input                             | Detected Pattern   | Action Triggered |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------- |
| "Unauthorized login attempt detected."    | unauthorized login | Flag Account     |
| "Account locked due to unusual activity." | account locked     | Notify Security  |
| "High risk transfer over threshold."      | high risk transfer | Flag Account     |

---

## Future Improvements

* Multilingual pattern detection (e.g., Arabic, French)
* Enhanced pattern matching using deep learning
* Dashboard for monitoring flagged activities
* Automated rule updates using machine learning insights
